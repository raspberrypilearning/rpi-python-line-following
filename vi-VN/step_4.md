## Test the line sensors

Next you're going to test whether your line sensors are working, and you'll tune them a little.

\--- task \---

With the line sensor attached, boot up your Raspberry Pi.

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

Cut two small holes in the bottom of your buggy so that the sensor can view the line beneath it, and secure your sensors in place.

When the sensors pass over a dark line, the LED on the sensor board should turn off.

\--- task \---

Use the small potentiometer on the board to tune your sensors, so that the LEDs turns off when over a dark line, and lights up when over white space.

Once you have tuned the sensors, you can proceed to programming your robot.
