## Prepare the connectors

Your first step will be to connect your line sensors to your buggy. Normally, the type of line sensor used in this project needs to be connected to a **3V3** pin, but you're going to run two sensors via the same power pin, so you'll attach both of them to a **5V** pin.

First, you're going to prepare your leads!
