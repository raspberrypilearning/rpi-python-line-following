## Introduction

In this resource, you will turn your robot buggy into a line-following robot buggy so it can whiz around a track with ease. Make sure you have already completed the [Build a buggy](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy) resource, or that you have a working buggy, before attempting this project.
