# Test the lines sensors

Next you're going to test that your line sensors are working and tune them a little.

--- task ---
Cut two small holes in the bottom of your buggy, so that the sensor can view the line beneath it, and secure your sensors in place.

When the sensors pass over a dark line, the LED on the sensor board should turn off.

Use the small potentiometer on the board, to tune your sensors, so that the LEDs turns off when over a dark line, and lights up when over whitespace.
